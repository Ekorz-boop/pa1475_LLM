# Multi-Method Block Tests

This directory contains test cases to verify the multi-method handling functionality for blocks.

## Purpose

The primary goal of these tests is to ensure that blocks can execute multiple methods in sequence, rather than just a single method. This enables more complex workflows within a single block.

## Test Cases

1. **Basic Multi-Method Configuration**
   - Tests that a block can be configured with multiple methods
   - Verifies the methods are stored correctly in the block instance

2. **Method Execution Sequence**
   - Tests that methods are executed in the specified order
   - Verifies all methods in the sequence are executed

3. **Data Flow Between Methods**
   - Tests that data flows correctly between method calls within the same block
   - Verifies output from one method is used as input for the next method

## Running Tests

To run these tests:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/multi_method_tests/test_multi_method_blocks.py
```
