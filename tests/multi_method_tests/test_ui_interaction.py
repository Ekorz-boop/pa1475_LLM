        Test Scenario: Selecting multiple methods in the block creation UI
        
        Steps:
        1. Open the custom block creation modal
        2. Select a library (e.g., langchain_community)
        3. Select a module (e.g., document_loaders)
        4. Select a class (e.g., PyPDFLoader)
        5. Verify multiple methods can be selected in the methods dropdown
        6. Select multiple methods (e.g., __init__, load, load_and_split)
        7. Add necessary parameters for each method
        8. Create the block
        
        Expected Result:
        - All selected methods should be saved with the block
        - The block should display a dropdown or similar UI to select which method to execute

        1. Create a block with multiple methods

        3. Verify methods can be reordered (drag & drop or similar)
        4. Change the order of methods
        5. Save the configuration

        3. Add parameters to different methods

        Expected Result:
        - Parameters should be correctly saved per method
